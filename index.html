    <P>This server is running <a href="https://github.com/fcecin/brocli">Brocli</a>, a simple Javascript application that reads data stored in the consensus memory (RAM) of an Antelope blockchain, following the <a href="https://github.com/fcecin/gpps/">GPPS</a> standard.</P>

    <P>This installation is connected to the <a href="https://uxnetwork.io">UX Network</a> blockchain, and is using the GPPS contract deployed to the <a href="https://explorer.uxnetwork.io/account/datastoreutx">datastoreutx</a> smart contract account.</P>
